     <div class="writing"><p class="parag">Africa Humanitarian Action is a pan-African international non-governmental
        organization (INGO) that provides effective relief, development and advocacy services.
        Founded in 1994 in response to the atrocities in Rwanda, AHA has supported over 12
        million people in 17 African countries to regain their health, dignity and wellbeing.
        At the heart of AHA’s work is a firm commitment to reducing poverty through
        addressing crisis-related suffering and laying the foundations for recovery and
        sustainable development. AHA works in partnership with local populations, listening
        and responding to people’s needs and empowering them to make lasting differences to
        their own lives. AHA believes that it is only through building on the capacities existent
        within communities and giving people ownership of their future, that sustainable
        change can be achieved.</p>
        
        <p class="parag">Complementary to the assistance AHA provides is its work in international advocacy,
        bringing a much needed Southern perspective to the global humanitarian arena. Since
        inception, AHA has striven to empower African civil society organizations and
        communities to ensure that they have the opportunity, confidence and space to generate
        meaningful contributions to humanitarianism.
        The strength of AHA is in its African roots and reach. It attempts to deliver sound
        programs and results. AHA is inclusive and makes use of the diversity and resources of
        the people it works with. AHA embraces change and innovation, at the same time as it
        seeks results that last. </p></div>
